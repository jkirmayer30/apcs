For each list, the height of the diagram is the amount of times we can
divide the sub-lists in half, multiplied by 2 because we need to assemble 
the list back together. The amount of times we need to halve the list before
we are left with only sorted lists of length 1 can be quantified for a list
of length x. This quantity should be the least integer value greater than log
base 2 of x. In each row of the diagram, every element in the starting
collection is either put into a smaller or larger array, which must be done in
linear time, since every element needs to be processed as part of a loop. 
Multiplying these two factors together, we find that the execution time must
be on the order of nlog(n) for a dataset of size n.
